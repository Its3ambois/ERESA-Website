              <h1> The Return  </h1>
              <h2> Chapter one </h2>
              <p>   In the darkness of an early spring morning, encarcerated men woke for the last sad sunrise of their lives. they are not to be pitied; among the swill in these cells are <i> murderers, theives, </i> and <i>liars</i> alike. <mark>The worst that society had to offer.</mark> </p>
              <p> Today was the great purge, the first day in the spring where prisoners were either freed or sent across the icy bridge. There was a steady solemnness about the group. All sat quietly, awaiting the blade. All <em> but one.</em>
                <p> "Say," one prisoners spoke, breaking the eerie silence. "At least we'll be out of this sewer."</p>
              <p>   "Aye," another replied. "<small>But our <b>bodies</b>'ll fertalize the ground.</small>" he continued in a croaky whisper. </p>
            <p> A few wept, a few pleaded, some even tried to fight their way out of the cell, but it was to no avail. The wardens easily immobilized their keep and chained them together like dogs. This was the way they would be transported to the courtroom, where the queen would bless their final passing and they would be finally <del>killed</del> <i>'dealt with'</i>.
              <p> "You seem awfully calm." An old an protested as he wa shackled to a younger boy. The old man was astounded to see that this stranger not only semed to welcom the guards, but had the <b>audacity</b> to <i>smile</i> as they were removed.
                "oh, yes, I am." The stranger agreed cockily."I'm excited, even."</p>
                <p>The old and dismayed man was <i>enraged</i> by the ignorant glee of this strange prisoner, but was also... <i>strangly</i> calmed by him. </p>
                <p><ins> "Even if I were to die today, I wouldn't be afraid."</ins> The young man seemed overly confident in himself. "But I already know I'll be walking out fine." The old man protested, explaining that there was <ins>no way</ins> that he would walk out alve. The younger man smiled and nodded, still unaffected by the attempts to bring him to earth. </p>

                <p> the dungeon door opened with a <sup>ScrEe</sup><sub>eeeeee</sub><sup>eeeeeCh</sup>, striking fear in the soon to be desceased prisoners. Now, tears and denial were running rampant among the crowd, but the strange young man seemed still unaffeted.They entered into a huge courtroom, decorated with angels and paintings, jurors and spectators circling the glass ceiling to see the executions. </p>
                <p> Two men went first. The queen gave them her soft speech in her flowery voice. She hated seeing the men go to their deaths, but she needed to give them a blessing. She seemed numb from the reoccuring event. </p>
                <p> She came to the strange young man. He couldn't contain his smile as he hung his head before her. She was beautiful, even though she was miserable. She stood in a white and gold gown, pampered and prettied beyind belief, almost <i>unrecognisable</i>, but he could still see the green in her lovely eyes.
                    "May the lords smile down upon your soul, and may they hold your hand as you cross the frozen bridge. Now, have you any last words before you are taken?" The man looked up to meet her eyes. her face when from nub to full of shock, awe, sadness, any emotion she could fathom.
                    "D'ja cut your hair?"</p>
